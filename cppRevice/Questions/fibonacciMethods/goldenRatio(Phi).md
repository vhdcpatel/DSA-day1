The golden ratio, often denoted by the Greek letter phi (Ï†), is a mathematical constant that appears in various natural phenomena and has aesthetic significance. It is approximately equal to 1.6180339887. The golden ratio can be expressed in terms of the square root of 5.

The connection between the golden ratio and the square root of 5 comes from the solution to a quadratic equation. The golden ratio is often defined as the positive solution to the equation:

\[ \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

This equation is derived from the fact that the ratio of two quantities (a + b) to the larger quantity (a) is the same as the ratio of the larger quantity (a) to the smaller quantity (b) when their ratio is the golden ratio.

The square root of 5 appears in the formula because it is part of the solution to the quadratic equation. The quadratic equation \( x^2 - x - 1 = 0 \) has solutions that can be expressed as \( \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \). The positive solution (\( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)) corresponds to the golden ratio.

In the context of Binet's formula for Fibonacci numbers, which involves the golden ratio, the square root of 5 is used to express the golden ratio in the formula:

\[ \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

This representation is convenient for mathematical calculations and is a common way to express the golden ratio in various mathematical contexts.
